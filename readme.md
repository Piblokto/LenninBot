# Lennin Bot
Please not that this bot doesn't support nor condone Vladmir Lennin. However this is just a meme bot for a discord server.

#### What is special about this bot?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing, this was just so I could learn discord.py. However it is kind of cool.

##### Pull Requests and Issues
If you have a suggestion of a feature to add to the bot. Feel free to email me at pib1okt0@protonmail.com.
Otherwise if there is an issue with the code/bot, feel free to submit an issue, or a pull request.

#### Setup
Firstly, you will need an [installation of Python](https://www.python.org/).
You will also need to make sure you have [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) installed

This can be installed on Windows through CMD with
``` pip install discord```

It can be installed on Linux with
```pip3 install discord```

You then want to add your own bot token/bot to the code (down the botton)
It's then as simple as running ```main.py``` .

## Coming Soon!
We're planning on adding the following;

    * More support to add this to your own Discord server with proper config files
    * More wacky and uncharacteristic features
    * Low-fi radio in voice chats
