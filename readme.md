# Lennin Bot
Please note that this bot doesn't support nor condone Vladmir Lennin. However this is just a meme bot for a discord server.

#### What is special about this bot?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing, this was just so I could learn discord.py. However it is kind of cool.

##### Pull Requests and Issues
If you have a suggestion of a feature to add to the bot, please submit an issue.
Otherwise if there is an issue with the code/bot, feel free to submit an issue, or a pull request.

### Setup
Installation is simple.

The only requirement is [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/).

You can then edit the config file (config.ini) using your text editor of your choice. Make sure to put your [bot token](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/), and if you wish; your own prefix (by default it will use !)

In the current version, there is only one requirement to run the bot, however for futureproofing, and other reasons, you're best off installing from the requirements.txt.
Requirements can be installed through 
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that it's just a matter of running main.py
```sh
python3 main.py
```
